 ## An example of data analysis from a product A/B test.

A company is developing an online shooting game. The game features an in-game currency that can be earned by winning matches or purchased with real-world money.

An A/B test is being conducted to gather insights on a promotional campaign offering a discount on an in-game item. It checks how the promo affected metrics:

- ARPU (average revenue per user) 
- ARPPU (Average revenue per paying user) 
- Spending of the in-game currency

However, the metrics are also influenced by users who cheat the game. The data is not entirely excluded for these users; thus, the project aims to clean the data for further analysis first, and than gather insights on the metrics.
